Autonomous food delivery carrier to restaurants with Obstacle Avoidance, Path Following and halt capabilities

The Autonomous Food Delivery Carrier is designed to navigate restaurant environments, avoiding obstacles, following paths, and halting at designated locations for efficient food delivery. The project leverages Arduino UNO microcontrollers, various sensors, and the Arduino C++ programming language to achieve autonomous control.
